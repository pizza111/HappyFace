The goal is to create an app called HappyFace for customers who want to do online shopping. This time, I will focus on the full range of Firebase functionalities rather than the UI. It will be written in SwiftUI with a very strong integration of Firebase, including features such as:

Done:
- Sign in with email (.createUser, .signIn, .signOut, .sendPasswordReset, .updateEmail, .updatePassword)
- Sign in with Google (.signIn, .signOut)
- Sign in with Apple (.signIn, .signOut)
  
Left:
- Sign in anonymously
- Firestore
- Queries
- Pagination
- Firebase storage
- Security
- Listeners
- Deleting user
